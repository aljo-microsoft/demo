This demo's a SFRP Windows Clusters and SF Minecraft Application resource declaration.

Requirements:
- Update AzureDeploy.parameters.json with Certificate property values.
- Update minecraftPkg/ApplicationManifest.xml "REPLACE_ACR_NAME" and "REPLACE_ENCRYPTED_ACR_PASSWORD"
  with credentials for openhack/minecraft-server:1.0-nanoserver-1803; or update the container registery/image/tag
  and creds appropriately. Also if you use an encrypted password, change 'PasswordEncrypted="False"' to
  'PasswordEncrypted="True"', and deploy your encryption cert by appending the Secrets properties of the Scale Sets resources
  in your ARM template with appropriate KV and cert properties.
- invoke sfpkg_stage.py from a shell with AZ CLI and python installed within this directory after cloning the repo.
- Perform a group deployments using AzureDeploy.json and AzureDeploy.parameters.json
